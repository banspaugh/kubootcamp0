Observations:

1. CBS and BBC on average have the most positive tweets
2. CNN and Fox have generally negative tweets, but they are only slightly negative.
3. NY times is slightly positive, I think based off the data BBC and CBS use positive
   emotionally charged words in their stories. While CNN, Fox, and NY Times
   generally have closer to neutral tweets, meaning they take more of an objective
   standpoint in reporting the news.
